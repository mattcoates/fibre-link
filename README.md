# Optical Fibre Link Project

This repository contains the results and scripts used for the testing of our optical fibre link.

## Clock Recovery
Scripts and results of the tests carried out on the FPGA that was performing clock recovery.

## Error Rate
Testing of the BER of the complete link.

## Header Detection
Scripts and results of the tests on the header detector.

## Image Testing
Results of using the link to transmit an image at different frequencies. 

## PRBS
Characterisation of a pseudo-random number generator used to generate dummy data to test the link.
